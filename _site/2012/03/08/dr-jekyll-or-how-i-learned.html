<p>After realizing that my <a href="http://adamallidina.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> has turned into a sad mess of auto-uploaded posts deprived of any real content, I had decided to build a proper blog for myself. Of course, this was September 2011 and &#8211; mainly due my natural tendancy to procrastinate &#8211; I&#8217;m posting this in March 2012. Anyways, I guess this would be my first official post on my shiny new Jekyll based blog.</p>
<p>Jekyll is a self-proclaimed &#8220;simple, blog aware, static site generator&#8221; as well as the newest platform that the tech community &#8211; <strong>cough</strong> Hacker News <strong>cough</strong> &#8211; seems to be drooling over. For the past few months I&#8217;ve frequently seen posts on the benefits of using Jekyll or its Python &amp; Django based alternative Hyde. Personally, I love the idea of a blog based on static html pages with automatically generated links. Of course, a blog means absolutly nothing if it doesn&#8217;t have any content &#8211; which is why I guess the real test is to see how often I end up updating this site.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all for now.</p>
