title: Pleased to Meet You Dr. Jekyll or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Static Site Generators

After realizing that my "Tumblr":http://adamallidina.tumblr.com has turned into a sad mess of auto-uploaded posts deprived of any real content, I had decided to build a proper blog for myself. Of course, this was September 2011 and - mainly due to excessive amounts of procrastination - I'm posting this in February 2012. Anyways, I guess this would be my first official post on my shiny new Jekyll based blog. 

Jekyll is a self-proclaimed "simple, blog aware, static site generator" as well as the newest platform that the tech community - *cough* Hacker News *cough* - seems to be drooling over. For the past few months I've frequently seen posts on the benefits of using Jekyll or its Python & Django based alternative Hyde.
